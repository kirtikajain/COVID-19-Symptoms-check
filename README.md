In addition to it the users are made to select the various symptoms regarding this deadly pandemic COVID-19. Based on the selected symptoms,age and gender inserted by the user the code predicts the probability of the user's testing positive of this virus. **LOGISTIC REGRESSION** algorithm is used for the precise results.
